**英译汉**（25分）  
The relationship that science keeps with art has long been that of one-sided enthusiasm. That is, while science loves art passionately, art keeps itself far away from science.  
Many renowned scientists love art all their lives. They understand art, and are very good at getting nutrients from art to enhance their noble spirits or to derive the greatest comfort from burdens of life. On the contrary, a literary artist who loves natural science and has some idea about engineering technology can be well regarded as a rarity of rarities.  
One of the reasons why artists stand in awe before science or keep a respectful distance from it is that science involves a huge stack of abstruse mathematical formulas. But leaving aside mathematics and bypassing that huge stack, we are still able to understand and appreciate the basic principles underlying a certain discipline of science. It is just like we are still able to give a passionate response to its main melody, greatly admiring the music although we can read nothing of the score of Mozart’s musical pieces.

长期以来，科学同艺术之间的关系一直是剃头担子一头热：科学热恋着艺术，艺术却拒科学于千里之外。  
许多大科学家一生钟爱艺术，且懂艺术，从中汲取养料，善养浩然之气，或得到人生最大安慰。相反，能热爱并且理解自然科学和工程技术的文学艺术家真可谓凤毛麟角。  
艺术家对自然科学望而生畏，敬而远之,原因之一是里面有一大堆高深的数学公式。其实，撇开数学，绕过那一大堆公式，一门学科的基本思想还是可以被我们理解和欣赏的．这恰如我们虽然看不懂莫扎特乐曲的总谱，却照样能同它的主旋律产生共鸣，击节称赞．

**汉译英**(25分)

《红楼梦》问世二百年以来，通过汉文原文和各种译文读过本书的人，无虑有多少个亿。这样多的读者哪一个是先看批评家的文章，然后再让批评家牵着鼻子走，按图索骥地去读原作呢？我看是绝无仅有。一切文学作品，特别是像《红楼梦》这样伟大的作品，内容异常地丰富，涉及到的社会层面异常地多，简直像是一个宝山，一座迷宫。而读者群就更为复杂，不同的家庭背景，不同的社会经历，不同的民族，不同的国家，不同的文化传统，不同的心理素质，不同的年龄，不同的性别，不同的职业，不同的爱好——还可以这样“不同”下去，就此打住——，他们来读《红楼梦》，会各就自己的特点。欣赏《红楼梦》中的某一个方面，受到鼓舞，受到启发，引起了喜爱；也可能受到打击，引起了憎恶，总之是千差万别。对这些读者来说，“红学家”就好象是住在“太虚幻境”里的圣人、贤人，与自己无关。他们不管“红学家”究竟议论些什么，只是读下去，读下去。

Ever since the publication of this novel some 200 years ago, hundreds of millions of people have read its Chinese original or its translations in various languages. Of these innumerable people, how many have read the novel by starting with a perusal of the critics&#8217; articles and allowing themselves to be led by the nose by the critics as to how to read the novel? Next to none. All literary works, especially a monumental one like A Dream of Red Mansions, are extremely rich in content and involve diverse social strata to such an extent that they virtually re<span class='wp_keywordlink'><a href="https://xiaoq.in/sem/" title="SEM搜索引擎营销" target="_blank">SEM</a></span>ble a mountain of treasure or a labyrinth. And the readers are even more complicated, differing from each other in family background, social experience, nationality, country, cultural tradition, psychological condition, age, sex, profession, hobby, etc. The list could go on endlessly, so i wouldn&#8217;t mind stopping here. They will each appreciate a certain aspect of the novel according to their own individuality. They may feel inspired and enlightened, and hence love it, or they may feel hurt, and hence loathe it. In short, the reactions vary. To them, the Redologists seem to be sages and men of virtue residing in the &#8220;Illusory Land of Great Void&#8221; and having nothing whatsoever to do with them. They just read on and on, caring not what the Redologists may say.
